# Homework 2 - responsive portfolio

## Description 

This website is a basic html-css-bootsrap page that contains an "about me", "contact" and "portfolio" page. 
Since I do not have enough websites to fill out an actual development portfolio, it is filled with pictures of my cat instead. These can be viewed as 2 columns in large-screen format, or single column in medium/small screen format.

Grid layout and navbar elements are possible thanks to bootsrap CSS.

Additional page elements like padding, colors, spacing, etc are thanks to additional style.css sheet that is located in repository.

Page design is a bit different than the examples since I used colors/backgrounds that looked a bit different and adapted the page to match. 

HTML was made more semantic than the default provided in bootstrap examples.
